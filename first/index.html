			Bin Laden’s message was quite clear:
 The attacks were carried out in response to
blatant and ongoing U.S. violations of the laws of war, together with almost every aspect
of international public and humanitarian law. The matter, as he pointed out, is of no mere
academic concern: over the past decade well upwards of a half-million Iraqi children and
at least a million of their adult counterparts have died as the result of pal-pably criminal
U.S. actions against their country. United Nations officials have resigned in protest,
denouncing what one of them, Assistant Secretary General Denis Halliday, was widely
quoted in the press describing as America’s “policy of deliberate genocide” against the
people of Iraq.

<br>
The accuracy of Halliday’s—and bin Laden’s—assessment of the situation
was, moreover, bluntly corroborated on NBC’s 60 Minutes by no less senior a U.S.
spokesperson than U.N. Ambassador, and subsequent Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright.7
