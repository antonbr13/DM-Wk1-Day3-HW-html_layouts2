					You may laugh at my idea, perhaps—but I could not help its occurring to me all the same. 
					Now with the rack and tortures and so on—you suffer terrible pain of course; but then 
					your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty of that) until 
					you die.

			<p>But HERE I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment 
					is, not the bodily pain at all — but the certain knowledge that in an hour,—then 
					in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now — this very INSTANT—your soul must 
					quit your body and that you will no longer be a man — and that this is certain, 
					CERTAIN! That’s the point—the certainty of it. Just that instant when you place 
					your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head—then—that quarter 
					of a second is the most awful of all.</p>
